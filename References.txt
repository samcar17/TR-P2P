MIDI CHART
http://aaron.headwai.com/ra/MIDI/MIDI%20Message%20Table%201.pdf


MIDI MSG TO SERVER contains: 
data.type: On/Off/CC assignment, string	//ON, OFF, CC
data.byte1: channel						//i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 etc...			
data.byte2: note/cc number				//1 - 127
data.byte3: velocity/cc val				// 1 - 127


WHAT HAPPENS IF THE MASTER DISCONNECTS? 
Do we choose a new master? DONE

HOW DO WE HANDLE SELECTING MIDI DEVICES?
Set them all up and let the user choose which to use? <- Inefficient
Might be able to close port and open new port? <- DONE!! 

SEND PKG ON: 
Click {add to state array, draw if on screen}
Delete {delete state array, re-draw pad, initialize stateArray}
Backspace {shortenStateArray, re-draw pad, re-draw seq}
Any extension (down arrow beyond padDivisionHighScore){extend state array, draw if on screen}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEXT BIG QUESTION: HOW DO WE HANDLE NEW CONNECTIONS IN THE MIDDLE OF JAM?
1) onConnection, server sends an update request to a random client
2) client replies with a pkg msg containing all the data the connecting client needs to get it up to date
3) connecting client then runs a fullUpdate function that covers all of the new info and alters it to match the others
4) finally, it recieves a CLK pkg from the other clients to get it on the same step

	{{{info for this!!}}}
	type: 'fullUpdate'
	stateArray
	padDivision
	padDivisionHighScore
	clk
	we need a 'newDivision' variable if extending
	and a 'numberOfBackspaces' variable if shortening
	
	
ADD: STOP/START	
	
BUG: Adding notes to sequence from non-master arrays gives buggy midi output. Graphics look fine though. Could be to do with noteOffs and how we're not sending the previous step's array?
